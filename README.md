# Youtube-Synch

The Youtube-Synch node is used for youtube's creator onboarding and replicating their content automatically on Joystream. This service does periodic syncing the videos from a youtube channel to a Joystream channel.

## Required Stack

- Docker
- aws cli
- npm >= 9.0.0
- nodejs >= 18.0.0

# Buildings the Youtube-Synch node

- Install dependencies
  `npm install`
- Build the project
  `npm run build`

# Running the Youtube-Synch node

## prerequisites

- A channel collaborator account should be setup on the Joystream network. This collaborator account will be used to replicate youtube videos to the Joystream network
- An App (metaprotocol) should be created on the Joystream network. This app will be used for adding videos attribution information to synced videos. The app `name` & a string `accountSeed` should be provided in the `config.yml` file. On how to create an app on the Joystream network, see [documentation](https://github.com/Joystream/joystream/blob/apps-metaprotocol/cli/README.md#joystream-cli-appscreateapp)

## Configuration

### Config file

All the configuration values required by Youtube-Synch node are provided via a single configuration file (either `yml` or `json`).

The path to the configuration will be (ordered from highest to lowest priority):

- The value of `--configPath` flag provided when running a command, _or_
- The value of `CONFIG_PATH` environment variable, _or_
- `config.yml` in the current working directory by default

### ENV variables

All configuration values can be overridden using environment variables, which may be useful when running the youtube-synch node as docker service.

To determine environment variable name based on a config key, for example `endpoints.queryNode`, use the following formula:

- convert `pascalCase` field names to `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`: `endpoints.queryNode` => `ENDPOINTS.QUERY_NODE`
- replace all dots with `__`: `ENDPOINTS.QUERY_NODE` => `ENDPOINTS__QUERY_NODE`
- add `YT__SYNCH__` prefix: `ENDPOINTS__QUERY_NODE` => `YT__SYNCH__ENDPOINTS__QUERY_NODE`

In case of arrays or `oneOf` objects (ie. `keys`), the values must be provided as json string, for example `YT_SYNCH__JOYSTREAM__CHANNEL_COLLABORATOR__ACCOUNT='[{"mnemonic":"escape naive annual throw tragic achieve grunt verify cram note harvest problem"}]'`.

In order to unset a value you can use one of the following strings as env variable value: `"off"` `"null"`, `"undefined"`, for example: `YT_SYNCH__LOGS__FILE="off"`.

For more environment variable examples see the configuration in [docker-compose.yml](./docker-compose.yml).

## Setting Up DynamoDB

Youtube-synch service uses DynamoDB to persist the state of all the channel that are being synced & their videos. The Youtube-synch node works with both the local instance of dynamoDB and cloud-based AWS instance.
For running a local instance of dynamodb, this is useful is useful for testing & development purposes, follow the steps below:

### Local DynamoDB

- `npm dynamodb:start` to start the local instance of dynamoDB.
- Also if you want to use the local instance of dynamoDB, you need to set the following environment variable:
  - `YT_SYNCH__AWS__ENDPOINT` to `http://localhost:4566`

### AWS DynamoDB

For using AWS dynamodb, generate AWS credentials (Access Key & Secret Key) for the user that has access to the DynamoDB table from the AWS Console.

Next there are two options, either you can provide the credentials in the `~/.aws/credentials` file or you can provide them as environment variables or in config file.

- For configuring these credentials in the `~/.aws/credentials` file using `aws configure` CLI command
- For configuring these credentials as environment variables, set the following environment variables:
  - `YT_SYNCH__AWS__CREDENTIALS__ACCESS_KEY_ID`
  - `YT_SYNCH__AWS__CREDENTIALS__SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`

## Running the node

Youtube-synch service can be run as a nodejs program or as a docker container. The service depends on the above described configurations so please make sure to configure the env vars/config file before running the node.

To run Youtube-synch service as nodejs program, run `npm start`

For running Youtube-synch service as a docker container, run `docker-compose up -d` at root of the project. This will start the service in the background.

# Doing Unauthorized replication/syncing of Youtube Channel's videos on joystream

There is a CLI command for doing unauthorized replication/syncing of Youtube Channel's videos on joystream. For more information see [sync:addUnauthorizedChannelForSyncing](./src/cli/docs/sync.md)

Also, if you want to sync multiple unauthorized channels, you can use [sync:syncMultipleUnauthorizedChannels](./src/cli/docs/sync.md) command

# Elasticsearch Alerting & Monitoring

The YT-Synch service logs can be sent to Elasticsearch instance, which then can be used to create alerting & monitoring rules based on the defined criteria. There is a [script](scripts/create-elasticsearch-alert.sh) designed to automate the creation of _Kibana Alert Rules_ and _Action Connectors_ for monitoring the Youtube Synchronization Service. The script creates an alert rule that queries Elasticsearch for any errors occurring in the service within the past some time (in minutes). If any errors are found, the script triggers email and Discord notifications to inform recipients of the issue. The script also creates the necessary connectors for sending these notifications.

## Environment Variables

The script uses the following environment variables to configure the alert rule and connectors:

- `KIBANA_URL`: The URL of the Kibana instance (default: `http://localhost:5601`).
- `ELASTIC_USERNAME`: The username for accessing Kibana (default: `elastic`).
- `ELASTIC_PASSWORD`: The password for accessing Kibana.
- `EMAIL_RECIPIENTS`: A comma-separated list of email addresses to receive email notifications.
- `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL`: The webhook URL for sending notifications to Discord.
- `THRESHOLD`: The threshold for triggering the alert (default: `10`).
- `EMAIL_CONNECTOR_NAME`: The name of the email connector to be created in Kibana (default: `Elastic-Cloud-SMTP`).
- `WEBHOOK_CONNECTOR_NAME`: The name of the webhook connector to be created in Kibana (default: `Discord Webhook`).
- `ALERT_RULE_NAME`: The name of the alert rule to be created in Kibana (default: `YT-Sync-Service-Alert`).

## How to Run the Script

1. Ensure that you have the required tools installed on your system: `bash`, `curl`, and `jq`.
2. Set the necessary environment variables in your shell or export them in a `.env` file.
3. Make the script executable by running `chmod +x scripts/create-elasticsearch-alert.sh`.
4. Run the script with `./scripts/create-elasticsearch-alert.sh`.

Upon successful execution, the script will create an alert rule and the required connectors in Kibana. If any errors are encountered, the script will display an error message with details on the issue.
